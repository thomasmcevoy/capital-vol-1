Marx — Capital Book I: The Process of Production of Capital
============================================================


Part One: Commodities and Money
--------------------------------

### Chapter 1: The Commodity
* 

##### Does Marx conflate value conferred by labor with market fluctuations due to supply & demand? (pp.130–131)
* His diamond example: are diamonds expensive because they are labor-intensive to extract, or because they are rare? 
* My wool example: the cost of alpaca > cashmere > merino. Is this because of differences in labor (is not the labor process the same in all cases?) or differences in scarcity? Or difference in quality/performance?

##### Does use-value really not factor into exchange value?
* In ch.1 sec.3, he says commodities only have value bc of the human labor they represent, not their use-value as objects. I'm struggling to accept this. My example is a banana, which I plucked from a tree. If it is the last banana on the tree and someone else is hungry, it has value to them not bc of my trivial labor in obtaining it from the tree, but because of its value to satisfy their need (hunger), and its scarcity.

##### Are commodities of the same type really always interchangeable?
* Maybe this was true in his time, but today any type of commodity can vary in price based on its producer and its perceived quality. There is variation in degree of effectiveness at accomplishing a task. At different price points, commodities of the same type ostensibly offer varying use-value commensurate with the exchange-value. Branding and marketing are independent factors that influence exchange-value also, though I can see how labor value is added this way.
* Unless he's saying that commodities of the exact same type are interchangeable, i.e. not all coats, but all coats made by a certain producer.


### Chapter 2: The Process of Exchange
* 


### Chapter 3: Money, or the Circulation of Commodities
* 



Part Two: The Transformation of Money into Capital
----------------------------------------------------

### Chapter 4: The General Formula for Capital
* Money takes the form of capital when it circulates in the form M-C-M', rather than C-M-C.
* The form C-M-C describes the conversion of one commodity into another, for the purpose of satisfying a material need. It is the pursuit of a use-value. The money received from the sale of the initial commodity comes to rest in a different place, in the hands of the person who sold the second commodity.
* The form M-C-M' describes the conversion of money into money, which only makes sense if the latter amount is higher than the former (M' > M). In this form, money comes to rest with its original source, the capitalist, but in an increased quantity. The amount of the increase is called surplus value.
* A key difference between these forms of exchange is that the capitalist form (M-C-M') results in an increase in value (surplus value) held by the capitalist by the end of the transactions, while the simple form of circulation (C-M-C) produces no surplus value, and the value of the commodities exchanged is equal.
* One is a capitalist to the extent that they use the market to create surplus value (using the process of market circulation of commodities to increase their wealth).
* Capital can be created through the exchange of commodities by merchants, in the process of commodity production itself, or through interest-bearing investment.


### Chapter 5: Contradictions in the General Formula
* How is it that simply by altering the form of commodity circulation from C-M-C to M-C-M, the entire nature of this transaction changes? The only change is that the sequence of the basic unit of exchange is inverted, and yet the result is a drastic change from a closed system in which value remains constant, to an open system which at each iteration produces more value for the capitalist.
* How is is that the parasitic nature of the M-C-M form is invisible to all parties but the capitalist?
* Surplus value cannot be explained by saying that commodities are always sold above their value, or below it. Because if one of these rules applied to all transactions, each individual would profit in one role and lose value in the other, leading to balance in the end (p.263).
* Due to the social nature of labor, every commodity can be considered to be produced by every person equally (p.264).
* M-C-M' is the form of merchants' capital, in which money is converted into more money through commodity exchange.
* M-M' is the form of usurers' capital, which skips the commodity step and simply exchanges money for more money.
* There is an apparent contradiction in that surplus value can not be generated without market exchange, and yet it does not seem to proceed from any market activity identified so far.


### Chapter 6: The Sale and Purchase of Labor-Power
* The surplus value can not be produced in the first transaction M-C, because the money is simply serving as objectification of the value of the commodity. For this same reason it can not be produced in the second transaction, C-M'.
* In order for an individual to be able to sell their labor-power on the commodity market, they must:
	1. Be a free person in full control of their ability to do labor and willing to sell it for a finite period of time.
	2. Not own the means of production which would allow them to use their labor to produce a commodity which they could then sell at market.
* Marx identifies two distinct social classes: those who own money or commodities, and those who own neither of these and must sell their own labor-power as a commodity. He notes that these two classes are not a law of nature, and exist only due to historical developments within certain societies.
* The value of labor-power is determined the same way as the value of any commodity: by considering what is necessary for its production. In the case of labor-power, it is a formula that takes into account how much resources are required for the subsistence of the laborer and his family, and also his training/education, divided by the number of days he is able to provide labor-power. If he is paid any less than this, the commodity (the man himself) will become deformed, functioning below capacity or even dying prematurely.



Part Three: The Production of Absolute Surplus-Value
----------------------------------------------------

### Chapter 7: The Labor Process and the Valorization Process
#### I. The Labor Process
* Labor is a process between man and nature in which man first conceives of a use for nature's materials and then proceeds to execute his plan using the faculties of his body and mind.
* The simple elements of the labor process are:
    1. Purposeful activity, that is work itself
    2. The object on which that work is performed
    3. The instruments of that work
* The object on which the labor is performed can be a pristine material provided by nature, or a raw material which has already been the object of some quantity of labor.
* The instruments of labor are primarily tools and machinery, but also containers, roads, workshops, canals, etc.
* The materials (natural or raw) and the instruments of labor are both _means of production_.
* A use-value can be both the finished product of one productive effort, and a raw material for another.
* The general character of the labor process is the same whether the laborer is working for his own subsistence or in the employ of a capitalist.
* The labor process in capitalism has two characteristics:
    1. The capitalist supervises the work to ensure it is of good quality, not wasting materials, nor wearing out the instruments of production any more than is necessary.
    2. The product is the property of the capitalist and not the laborer who is its immediate producer.

#### 2. The Valorization Process
* As described in the previous chapter, the value and therefore exchange-value of labor-power is the amount of resources required for the survival of the laborer.
* The use-value of labor-power is greater than its value.
* Marx's example is that the value or exchange-value of labor-power is half a day's labor, while its use-value is a whole day's labor, or twice as much.


### Chapter 8: Constant Capital and Variable Capital
* A worker can add fresh value to an existing use-value only if their labor is _social labor_: that is, labor-power directed in such a way that it preserves the value of the use-value while also adding new labor that transforms it into a new and different use-value, whose value is the value of the initial use-value plus the value of the added labor.
* In addition to this additional labor being necessarily social labor, it must also be of the quality required in the circumstance, for instance spinning in order to add value to cotton by spinning it into yarn. A smith or a weaver could not have added that value. Therefore, both elements of labor's twofold nature must be right in order for it to add value.
* Another duality in labor is the different ways it can add value. A less productive form of labor adds more value to each commodity, because it takes longer to complete. A more productive form of labor is quicker, therefore adding less value to each commodity, but producing a greater number of commodities in the same amount of time, which in total have a higher value than the commodity in the first example.
* _Constant capital_ refers to the means of production (raw materials, instruments of labor, etc) which transfer their value, magnitude unchanged, to the new use-value.
* _Variable capital_ refers to the labor-power which transfers not only its own value, but a quantity of surplus value (the exact quantity of which may vary) to the commodity it produces.
* Means of production : labor-power :: constant capital : variable capital
* These two forms of capital remain distinct regardless of fluctuations in the price of means of production (i.e. raw materials) or in the efficiency of labor power that may be affected by the sophistication of instruments of production.


### Chapter 9: The Rate of Surplus-Value
#### I. The Degree of Exploitation of Labor-Power
* C (capital) = c (constant capital) + v (variable capital)
* C' (valorized capital) = (c + v) + s (surplus value)
* Since the constant part of capital will be the same before and after the production process, we can drop it from both sides of the equation.
* Amount of value added by labor = v + s
* Rate of surplus value (or profit or exploitation) = s / v
* The work day can be divided into two parts. In the first part, the laborer produces the amount of value required for his own subsistence, which Marx calls _necessary labor_. In the second part, the laborer produces the surplus value for the capitalist, and Marx calls this _surplus labor_.
* s / v = surplus labor / necessary labor

#### 2. The Representation of the Value of the Product by Corresponding Proportional Parts of the Product
* The value of a quantity of a commodity can be considered by dividing the total quantity of the commodity into parts, each representing a different type or source of value of the total.
* For example, 20 lbs of yarn contains 30s. of value, which can be divided into 24s. constant capital, 3s. variable capital, and 3s. surplus value.
* Thus we can divide the 20 lbs into these proportions: 16 lbs represents the constant capital, 2 lbs variable capital, and 2 lbs surplus value.
* The same idea can be expressed in terms of time: of a 12 hour work day, a laborer spends 9.6 hours to reproduce the value of the constant capital, 1.2 hours to reproduce the variable capital (the cost of his wages), and 1.2 hours to create the surplus value.

#### 3. Senior's 'Last Hour'
* Economist Nassau W. Senior wrote a pamphlet heavily influenced by manufacturers' interests against the newly passed Factory Act and the Ten Hours' Agitation.
* The main points of the pamphlet are:
	1. The majority of the 11 1/2 hour workday goes towards replacing the capital investment.
	2. Profit is only generated in the last hour.
	3. If the workday was shortened by an hour, no profit would be produced at all.
	4. If it was extended to 13 hours, profit would more than double.
* Marx's criticisms are as follows:
	1. If Senior believed manufacturers that the workers spent the best part of the day in reproduction of the capital advanced, he should have responded that the number of hours spent replacing the capital advanced is proportional to the length of the workday, so in a shorter day fewer hours will be spent replacing the capital invested.
	2. If on the other hand Senior were to investigate the question of the relation of net profit to the length of the working day, he should separate constant capital from variable capital. If the laborer only produces value in the last two hours during which he produces the value of his own labor and the surplus value, yet works an 11 1/2 hour day, then we must divide the total value produced by the total number of hours worked: i.e. he reproduces his own wages in 5 3/4 hours, and the surplus value in the other 5 3/4 hours.
	3. By extension, if the working day were extended by 1 1/2 hours, the rate of surplus value would not "double", but would increase from 100% to 126 2/23%, as derived by the quotient of 7 1/4 / 5 3/4.
	4. Similarly, if the working day were reduced by 1 1/2 hours, the rate of surplus value would not "vanish", but would drop from 100% to 82 14/23%: 5 3/4 / 4 3/4. (Why not 4 1/4?)

#### 4. The Surplus Product
* The _surplus product_ is the quantity of product produced by surplus labor.
* The relative amount of surplus product must be compared not to the sum total of the capital, but to its variable part, i.e. necessary labor.
* The sum of necessary labor and surplus labor = the entire length of the working day.


### Chapter 10: The Working Day
#### I. The Limits of the Working Day
* The length of the working day is the sum of the period of necessary labor (AB) and the following period of surplus labor (BC).
* The working day's minimum length cannot be determined, because in a capitalist mode of production it must be longer than the period of necessary labor, but precisely how much longer cannot be pinpointed.
* Its maximum length is bound by both physical limitations (how long a human body is capable of working in a 24 hour period) and moral ones (humans should have free time outside of work in which to pursue their own private interests). But both factors vary in different societies, producing a wide array of different working day lengths.
* There is a tension between the interest of the capitalist, who wishes to extract maximum use-value from their purchase of labor-power, and the laborer, who wishes to conserve their sole source of wealth (labor-power). "I demand a normal working day because, like every other seller, I demand the value of my commodity."
* A mathematical argument: the average working life of an adult is 30 years. If the worker is worked so hard that they can only work 10 years, but are paid wages derived from a 30-year career, they are only paid 1/3 of the value of their labor.

#### 2. The Voracious Appetite for Surplus Labor. Manufacturer and Boyar
* Surplus labor is not unique to capitalism; in any society where a portion control the means of production, the rest must do extra work to produce the means of subsistence for these owners.
* However in societies that focus on use-value, extraction of surplus value is relatively limited.
* Capitalism focuses on exchange-value, producing conditions which incentivize owners to extract the maximum possible amount of surplus value.
* Describes the corvée of Wallachian peasants, both how it is officially laid out (14 days/year) and in reality (56+ days/year), a rate of corvée to necessary labor of 66 2/3%.
* The English Factory Acts are nominally intended to protect the laborer from exploitation, yet they actually serve the capitalists' long term interests by not exhausting the labor force to the point of sickness or premature death.
* Even under the Factory Act, the capitalist will take every opportunity to steal a few minutes' labor from the worker. These small thefts add up to a substantial sum over the longer term. And this potential profit is far greater than the small penalty the capitalist risks if his exploitation is discovered, making it simply a "cost of doing business."

#### 3. Branches of English Industry Without Legal Limits to Exploitation
* In this section Marx gives examples of extreme labor exploitation in the UK, comparing it to American slavery.
* The lace industry employed children of 9 and 10 for days sometimes 20 hours long, conditions the employers disdained to discuss.
* The potteries of Staffordshire employed children as young as 7 years old for 15 hours a day, 6 days a week. If this were not enough, they were sometimes forced to work overnight for no extra pay, and to work through abbreviated mealtimes. The effects are seen in increased disease and mortality among potters, and diminished physical stature over generations.
* The match industry created the disease tetanus, and half its employees were under the age of 18. Children as young as 6 years old worked 12–15 hour days. The conditions were so bad that only families in the most dire circumstances would send their children to manufacture matches. 

#### 4. Day-Work and Night-Work. The Shift System
* Any moment that constant capital is not producing surplus value is a missed opportunity for the capitalist, and thus capitalism naturally moves towards utilization of labor-power during the full 24 hours of each day.
* This night work is performed by men, women, and children as young as 6. It is done every day of the week, including Sunday which is normally not a work day.
* Night work and the shift system opens new opportunities for the capitalist to extract additional unpaid work from the laborer.
* Manufacturers justify child labor as follows:
    1. It keeps the cost of production down, and the trade might not survive otherwise.
    2. It benefits the men, whether by giving them relief from night work,
    3. giving them someone to boss around,
    4. giving them a source of extra pay (at the expense of the boys, and a classic move dividing the working class against itself), or
    5. keeping production costs down so the men are not burdened by them (what?)
    6. Without boys sharing the burden of night work, it would fall entirely on the men, and would become too much, leading to the abolishing of night work altogether (so?)

#### 5. The Struggle for a Normal Working Day. Laws for the Compulsory Extension of the Working Day, from the Middle of the Fourteenth to the End of the Seventeenth Century
* Under capitalism, the working day is extended to its maximum length in order to extract the greatest possible quantity of surplus value from the worker. The life of a working class person has no purpose other than to produce surplus value for the capitalist, and indeed the length and quality of such a life is diminished in exchange for its increased work capacity in the short term.
* The duration of the working day/week established by early laws (~14th century) is roughly the same as the "limits" imposed by later laws (mid/late 17th century). In other words, early capitalists had to use the power of the state to extend the working day, but after centuries of development, this extended day was so established that the laws could now "limit" it to the same duration.
* Though it seems that the slave's long healthy life would be in the interest of the master, who has to purchase a new slave when the old one dies. But in America and other slave economies, the prevailing wisdom is to extract maximum value as quickly as possible, and so English labor follows these practices. The wage labor system provides even less incentive for capitalists not to work their laborers to death, because they purchase not the whole life of a person, but just a few weeks' worth of their labor-power at a time.
* Postlethwayt argued against a long work day/week: All work and no play; English artists and manufacturers owe their ingenuity and dexterity to having a reasonable amount of time for relaxation and self-development. Their productivity and the quality of their output would fall if they were forced to work longer hours.
* Anonymous response: 
    1. The six day work week is implied by the Sabbath, for if Sunday is designated a day of rest, then the other six days must be for work.
    2. People are by nature lazy and won't work more than necessary. Therefore they must be forced to work.
    3. Those who work six day weeks (agricultural workers, Dutch manufacturers, and the French) seem to be the happiest of people (based on what?!)
    4. The poor working class is inferior to those who have money, and also outnumber them 7 to 1. As they have the numbers, it is necessary to suppress and control them.
    5. This could be accomplished by paying them less, forcing them to work all the time. Then, when they are completely impoverished, locking them up in a workhouse described as a "House of Terror" (wtf!)

#### 6. The Struggle for a Normal Working Day. Laws for the Compulsory Limitation of Working Hours. The English Factory Legislation of 1833–64
* The Factory Act of 1833 was the first English labor law:
    1. The working day is from 5:30 a.m. — 8:30 p.m.
    2. Young persons (ages 13–18) can work 12 hours a day.
    3. Children (ages 9–13) can work 8 hours a day.
    4. Night work was forbidden for those under 18.
    5. A minimum of 1 1/2 hours must be allowed for meals.
* This first Factory Act was met with intense resistance by capitalists, who confounded enforcement by devising a staggered system of bookkeeping for children's shift and meal timings.
* A second Factory Act of 1844 was passed:
    1. Women over 18 could work 12 hours a day, no nights.
    2. Children under 13 could work 6 1/2 hours per day.
    3. Staggered shifts are not allowed.
    4. A printed notice of shift and meal times must be publicly posted.
    5. Other detailed limits on shift and meal abuse.
* A new Factory Act of 1847 passed, reducing the working day for young persons and women to 11 hours, which would be reduced again to 10 the following year.
* The manufacturers lowered wages with each reduction of hours, by a total of at least 25%. They then tried to agitate workers to call for the repeal of the Factory Acts, but were unsuccessful. They found ways to obey the letter of the law but not the spirit, such as by spacing children's afternoon work in such a way as to keep them at the factory as late as the men. They argued that working conditions were less important than England's industrial and economic prominence as a nation, an argument that capitalists still make today.
* The use of the shift system for young persons and women effectively gave capitalists control over their labor for the full working day, while observing the letter of the law.
* An 1850 verdict found that manufacturers were indeed evading the spirit of the law, but also found flawed language in the law, effectively nullifying it. This resulted in increasingly widespread abuses of the same type.
* This development was met with immediate and vigorous protest by the workers, resulting in the supplementary Factory Act of 1850, which limited the work of young people and women to 10 1/2 hours per weekday and 7 1/2 on Saturday, with minimum 1 1/2 hours for meals and requirements that the day's parameters and mealtimes are always the same.

#### 7. The Struggle for a Normal Working Day. Impact of the English Factory Legislation on Other Countries
1. The working day was first extended in the more technologically advanced industries like those producing cotton, wool, flax, and silk. It then spread to the more archaic.
2. History shows that the individual worker has no power to resist increasing exploitation by the manufacturers, and gains such as the Factory Act were only won by sustained collective working class effort in "civil war" with the capitalists.


### Chapter 11: The Rate and Mass of Surplus-Value
* Laws of surplus value:
    1. The mass of surplus-value produced is equal to the amount of the variable capital advanced multiplied by the rate of surplus-value.
    2. There is a natural limit to how much surplus value a worker can create in a day, as a day lasts only 24 hours and a worker cannot work every hour of every day.
    3. Any variation in value and surplus value produced by a quantity of capital is due to the variable capital (labor) component, as the constant capital will merely pass its value to the products.
* 



Part Four: The Production of Relative Surplus-Value
---------------------------------------------------

### Chapter 12: The Concept of Relative Surplus-Value
* It is thought that necessary labor is a fixed quantity, and that surplus labor and therefore surplus value can only be increased by lengthening the working day.
* Surplus value can be increased by paying workers less than the value of their labor, but that situation (which does occur in the real world) is not part of the abstraction Marx is considering in Capital where all commodities are purchased at their full value.
* There is another way surplus value can be increased without lengthening the working day, and that is by decreasing the value of labor by increasing productivity.
* _Absolute surplus value_ is surplus value produced by lengthening the working day.
* _Relative surplus value_ is surplus value produced by shortening the necessary labor time.
* Increased productivity in industries which provide means of subsistence decreases the cost of subsistence, which decreases the value of labor, which decreases the length of necessary labor in the working day, increasing surplus value unless the workday is shortened.
* Increased productivity also produces more of a commodity which is now worth less because it contains less labor time. The capitalist now sells more products with a slimmer profit margin on each, ostensibly deriving the same total profit when all are sold, but in addition to this they now get more (relative) surplus value produced each workday.
* Relative surplus value is directly proportional to productivity, and therefore the capitalist is incentivized to increase productivity in order to cheapen commodities and ultimately the value of labor power itself.


### Chapter 13: Co-operation
* Capitalism involves a large number of laborers working together in the employ of a capitalist.
* Individual variations in the skill of the workers is balanced out by their numbers to an average.
* By employing a large number of workers in the same facility, the capitalist saves on means of production, leading to a proportional fall in the value of commodities and ultimately labor power.
* _Co-operation_ is when numerous workers work side by side in accordance with a plan.
* Co-operation can achieve results impossible for the individual, such as raising a heavy weight, turning a winch, etc.
* Men working together are also more productive than working alone, due to their social and competitive nature.


### Chapter 14: The Division of Labor and Manufacture
#### I. The Dual Origin of Manufacture
* Manufacture is the classical manifestation of cooperation based upon the division of labor. It can arise in two ways:
    1. Artisans of various trades collaborate in the production of a complex commodity, such as a carriage. Eventually they lose the full range of skills of their trade and become specialized in the task required for their job.
    2. Artisans who initially each produced a complete commodity begin to divide the labor such that each must only accomplish a single step in the production process.
* This is a form of cooperation, and is an improvement to the production process because it is cooperative in general, not necessarily because of the exact form of cooperation.

#### 2. The Specialized Worker and His Tools
* Compared to the old form, in which a craftsman would complete all the steps of production, the process of manufacture produces a specialized worker whose workday consists of repeatedly performing the same task.
* This increases productivity by eliminating pauses in which the worker transitions from one operation to another, and also perfects both the worker's skill at his task and his tools, which can also be perfectly designed to suit his specialized role.
* Commodities produced in this way can be more refined and higher quality, as each step of production can be perfectly dialed in.
* This sort of specialization can dull the worker's overall skill, as he does not regularly practice all the skills of his trade. It can also be boring. And the practice of hereditary passing of a trade down through generations of a family is a sort of caste system.

#### 3. The Two Fundamental Forms of Manufacture — Heterogeneous and Organic 
* _Heterogeneous manufacture_ is a form of production in which a commodity is assembled from a number of parts that can be made independently, ie a watch.
* _Organic manufacture_ is when the raw materials pass in stages from one worker to the next, like an assembly line, at each station moving one step closer to becoming the finished product. 
* In organic manufacture the finished product of one worker becomes the raw material for the next, and so a certain speed of production is internally enforced in this method. 
* Also, different tasks require different amounts of time, and so a certain ratio of workers is required at each stage of production. Once this ratio is established it must be maintained.
* Workers at stages of organic manufacture can be homogenous, or they can be a team comprising various skills that work together.
* "The collective worker, formed out of the combination of a number of specialized workers, is the item of machinery specifically characteristic of the manufacturing period."
* Since these various functions require differing levels of skill and training, a hierarchy of wages develops.
* The system of manufacture causes the value of labor power to fall. For unskilled workers there is no cost of training, and for skilled workers it is diminished owing to the narrower range of skill that must be developed.

#### 4. The Division of Labor in Manufacture, and the Division of Labor in Society
* There are two ways that division of labor may develop:
    1. Independent communities or tribes, each with its own means of production and resulting commodities, trade with neighboring communities. This is a process of independence leading to interdependence.
    2. Communities may divide labor based on physical or mental capacity. As these endeavors grow, the forms of labor become more specialized, the "organs" of production gain more and more independence. This is a process of interdependence leading to independence.
* A key difference between the division of labor in manufacture and in society is that the latter case produces commodities, while in the former, only in the end of the process of manufacture has a commodity been produced.
* This reveals different economic relations of the workers to what they produce. Division of labor within society leads to independent tradesmen who own the commodities they produce and will sell. Division of labor within manufacture leads to laborers who do not own what they produce, and what they sell is their labor power.
* Division of labor within society is an a posteriori phenomenon, arising naturally and in response to the needs of society. Division of labor within manufacture is a priori and controlled by one person, the capitalist.
* "Authority within the workshop and authority in society, in relation to the division of labor, are in inverse relation to each other." (Footnote 36, p.477)

#### 5. The Capitalist Character of Manufacture
* Beyond the minimum of constant and variable capital required for the capitalist process of manufacture, the benefits of further division of labor requires both more workers and more raw materials.
* Manufacture makes the worker the property of the capitalist, and dulls his productive capacity beyond the narrow scope of his function in the manufacture process. There are cases where "semi-idiots" were preferred to perform simple operations which were trade secrets.
* As a remedy for this stupidity Adam Smith proposes education by the state. Garnier disagrees, saying that education of the people would cause "our whole social system [to] be proscribed."
* Though it increased the rate of exploitation, the system of manufacture failed to appropriate all the worker's potential labor time, as it also failed to revolutionize production to its very core. It did produce the means for its next stage of evolution, factories which produce machines to be used in production.


### Chapter 15: Machinery and Large-Scale Industry
#### I. The Development of Machinery
* Manufacture and machinery both represent transformations of the mode of production. In the former the starting point is labor-power, while the latter starts with the instruments of labor.
* Tool vs machine
* A machine consists of 3 parts: the motor, the transmitting mechanism, and the working tool or implement.
* Machines change the relation of workers to labor. A manufacturing worker performed all the operations of his job with his hands or by manipulating tools by hand. Machines would take over the manual operations, leaving humans to merely oversee the operation of the machine and occasionally correct its mistakes. (p.497)
* Machines can also perform multiple tasks simultaneously, or multiple instances of the same task, while a human laborer can only do one thing at a time.
* Different sorts of motive power were considered, and water was found to be the best. In the form of a steam engine, water could provide a motive force that was not tied to any particular location, and which could provide more or less power as needed under the control of a human operator.
* Cooperation, an advance in manufacture, similarly occurs between machines in large scale industry. (p.499)
* Sometimes a commodity can be produced by a single machine, in which case the factory would consist of many machines of the same kind working side by side, each producing, for instance, envelopes.
* Or it can be produced by a series of machines working in series, which seems to parallel the division of labor in manufacture. But in this case the steps do not need to be adapted to the limitations of human workers, and can be reimagined or streamlined for machines.
* An organized system of machines is the most developed form of production by machinery. In some cases certain parts of the system, certain machines, may require manual intervention. In others, the system is fully automated and even able to handle edge cases such as when a piece breaks or the raw material is depleted.
* Mechanical development in one stage of industrial production, for example machine spinning, necessitates mechanization in the rest of the stages: machine weaving, mechanical and chemical bleaching, printing, and dyeing.
* Similarly, the means of communication and transport must develop, leading to steam-powered river and ocean vessels, railways, and telegraphs.
* The tool portion of an industrial machine tends to correspond to a tool of manufacture, but at a much larger scale. For example drill, lathe, tools of carpentry, shears, a hammer.
* The first large-scale industrial machines were manufactured by highly skilled craftsmen. As the machines became more elaborate and precise, they could only be produced by other machines.
* Correspondingly, the division of labor in manufacture is not necessary and "subjective", to use Marx's term. In contrast, division of labor in large-scale industry is necessary and a material pre-condition, because production can only be carried out by a series of machines built for this purpose.

#### 2. The Value Transferred by Machinery to the Product
* Machinery does not create new value, but transfers its own value to the product (p.509)
* Machine production both raises the value of commodities (by transferring the machine's value to the commodity) and ultimately decreases their value (by increasing productivity so that more commodities can be made in a given time, each commodity receiving less value from the machine than it would have received from human labor).
* The productivity of a machine is measured by the human labor power it replaces (p.513). As long as the machine transfers less of its own value to the commodity, it is more productive than human labor.
* Because human labor is not paid at full value, "even if the machine costs as much as the labor-power displaced by it, the labor objectified in it is still much smaller in quantity than the living labor it replaces.
* The benefit to the capitalist of using machine production depends solely on the costs of the machine per commodity produced vs that of human labor. For this reason, machines invented in one region may be used only in another area (examples on p.516).
* In some regions, the development of machines led to a surplus of labor, causing the price of labor to fall, ultimately making human labor cheaper than that of machines.

#### 3. The Most Immediate Effects of Machine Production on the Worker
##### (a) Appropriation of Supplementary Labor-Power by Capital. The Employment of Women and Children
* Machines take over the work formerly done by the muscles of men, eliminating physical strength as a necessary factor of labor. Thus, women and children could join the workforce.
* As the price of labor is derived from the cost necessary to sustain the worker and his family, its price drops when all family members work and contribute to their own sustenance.
* This results in the family's earning more money overall, while also increasing the rate of surplus value (i.e. exploitation) (p.518). Seems analogous to the common reactionary argument that capitalism raises the standard of living (which ignores the increasing degree of exploitation).
* The employment of entire families led to a high mortality rate of young children of workers, upwards of 26% in some districts. These children experienced lack of food, dosing with opiates, and estrangement from their mothers (p.521).
* Education requirements of the Factory Acts were a farce. Classes were large and met irregularly, subject to the exigencies of factory work, and teachers were uneducated, in some cases unable to spell their own names.

##### (b) The Prolongation of the Working Day
* Machines allow production to be conducted 24 hours a day, only held back by the availability of human labor power.
* As the machine operates, it transfers its value to the products. The total quantity of value it can transfer in its lifetime is unchanged whether it operates 8 hours a day or 24, but the latter case will yield the value three times sooner, helping avoid what Marx calls "moral depreciation", which is when an older machine loses value relative to newer, more efficiently-produced machines. (p.528) Thus, the capitalist is incentivized to run the machine constantly and absorb its surplus value as quickly as possible.
* A capitalist can increase surplus value by increasing the scale of production. Given a working day of limited length, he must spend more on both constant and variable capital to accomplish this. Lengthening the working day, however, allows him to increase surplus value while decreasing the amount spent on both kinds of capital (p.529).
* Machinery increases surplus value by cheapening commodities and therefore the cost of reproduction of human labor power. They also provide a huge temporary advantage to their owners before the rest of the industry catches on, after which the surplus value comes from the laborers (variable capital).
* There is a contradiction in that machines can provide a temporary competitive advantage by increasing productivity, yet ultimately decrease the proportion of variable capital, which is the primary source of surplus value (p.531).
* Thus the capitalist's motivation to extend the working day—to run his machinery nonstop to realize its value before it depreciates, and to maximize the amount of variable capital set in motion, and therefore quickly extract the maximum amount of surplus value from the whole enterprise.

##### (c) Intensification of Labor
* The aforementioned extension of the working day was met with resistance from the working class, and eventually laws were enacted limiting its length. Thus the capitalist, unable to lengthen the working day, looked for ways to increase the intensity of labor in order to produce more relative surplus value within the limited temporal bounds of the working day.
* This increased intensity of labor causes the worker to condense the quantity of labor typically provided in a 12 hour working day into the newly won 10 hour day.
* How is labor intensified?
    1. Working fewer hours, the laborer's energy and attention are spread less thinly and are therefore available in greater abundance for each moment of work. Capitalists argued against this idea but were empirically wrong, i.e. Robert Gardner's factories in Preston (p.535).
    2. Machines continually improve, working faster, more efficiently, costing less, and shrinking in size.
    3. Each laborer can be instructed to operate or oversee increasingly more pieces of machinery.
* A number of accounts show that increasingly refined machines produce faster, requiring laborers to work faster to keep up. This is combined with decreasing numbers of workers overall, and a greater proportion of children in the workforce.
* Though the working day was shortened, workers must work faster and produce more in 10 hours than previously in 12, and so their exploitation is still increased.

#### 4. The Factory
* Automated factory work eliminates the hierarchy of workers by eliminating the need for specialized skills. Now the machine does the skill work, largely reducing laborers to the role of menial machine-minders.
* These factory workers generally are either employed on the machines (i.e. minding the engine), or merely attending them (i.e. feeding raw material into the machine. These workers are generally children). There are also some few skilled engineers who repair the machine and keep it operational.
* Since the majority of labor is unskilled, workers can be shuffled about at will. This was seen in the _relay system_ employed during the manufacturers' revolt of 1848–50.
* Forms of exploitation in the automated factory:
    1. Workers must work faster to keep up with increasingly faster machines, and longer hours because of the capitalists' incentive to run their machines nonstop.
    2. The work is menial, dulling the minds of workers and rendering them unskilled and thus dependent on the automated factory as their only possible workplace.
    3. Productivity constantly increases, driving down the cost of the worker's daily subsistence and thus thier wages.
* Under these conditions, machinery has replaced human labor power as the primary mechanism of production.
* Machinery is originally produced by human labor power in the service of capital, and is thus capital itself confronting the human worker.
* The capitalist is the owner of the machines and thus the "master" over the workers, who have no choice but to participate in this system which is based on the power of "the science, the gigantic natural forces, and the mass of social labor embodied in the system of machinery." (p.549)
* "The overseer's book of penalties replaces the slave-driver's lash." (p.550)

#### 5. The Struggle Between Worker and Machine
* Workers exploited by capitalism initially "fought against the instrument of labor itself, capital's material mode of existence." (p.554)
* "It took both time and experience before [they] learned to distinguish between machinery and its employment by capital, and therefore to transfer their attacks from the material instruments of production to the form of society which utilizes those instruments." (p.555)
* Workers were exploited by capitalism before the advent of large-scale machinery. But that development intensified their estrangement and alienation into full-on antagonism, as seen in the protracted starvation and deaths of English hand-loom weavers in the first few decades of the 19th century, or the acute devastation of Indian cotton workers in 1834–5 (p.558).
* "The instrument of labor strikes down the worker" (p.559) most obviously when automated machinery is first introduced into a field of industry, but also continuously thereafter, as improvements to machinery continue to diminish the number of workers needed and their wages.
* The American Civil War had the effect of increasing the number of factories, power looms, spindles, and workers employed. After the war, all these numbers dropped except spindles. This signifies an increase in productivity of the looms, which led to an increase in spindle use and a decrease in the number of looms and human labor. The decrease in number of factories shows the consolidation of newly more productive means of production among fewer capitalists.
* In addition to competing with human labor, machines produce weapons intended for use against working class revolt.
* Ure is contradictory in his writing on the effect of machinery on the working class. He condemns working class resistance to machinery as "short-sighted...violent collisions and interruptions" delaying the factory system's development "beneficially for all concerned." He elsewhere notes that it is fortunate for cotton workers that improvements of machinery are gradual, and acknowledges the harmful effects on the number of workers employed and their wages (p.564).

#### 6. The Compensation Theory, With Regard to the Workers Displaced by Machinery
* Compensation theory is the bourgeois idea that workers being displaced by machines doesn't harm them because it "frees up" capital for their employment elsewhere.
* Investment in machinery increases the amount of constant capital and decreases the amount of variable capital (labor power). It also increases productivity and diminishes the number of workers needed, both decreasing the price of labor.
* The production of the machinery itself wouldn't employ more workers than the machinery displaces. The price of the machinery includes the means of production, labor, and surplus value, so only a small portion of that cost goes towards labor.
* Therefore, instead of "creating jobs", investment in machinery diminishes the number of jobs and decreases the value of labor, both of which benefit capitalists by harming the working class.
* A worker displaced from his industry by machinery could find work in another industry. But in this case he is not being employed by the capital that displaced him, but some other capital. And as he is working in a new industry, he is not skilled and thus his labor will be worth less than before.
* The bourgeois defense of machinery amounts to: "machines don't exploit workers, capitalists exploit workers. Machines are just tools and have many good uses. Thus anyone against exploitation is anti-machine and anti-progress".
* As machinery increases productivity in a given industry, the demand for raw materials increases. This may lead to temporary increased demand for labor to produce those raw materials, until that labor market becomes saturated and the value of labor falls, or until machinery is developed which will gradually replace workers in that field too.
* Ultimately the capitalist application of machinery augments the production of surplus-value and thus worker exploitation. Wealthy capitalists desire more luxurious commodities, and as the same capitalists control production, they can choose to produce more of the luxury commodities they desire.
* If the increased capitalist employment of machinery frees up workers in any way, it "frees" them from having to labor in a productive industry, making them available to labor unproductively as servants to the capitalist class.

#### 7. Repulsion and Attraction of Workers Through the Development of Machine Production. Crises in the Cotton Industry
* Any respectable political economist must concede that machinery and large scale industry has a harmful effect on the artisan or handicraft worker. And yet they will argue that this effect is merely a temporary setback on the journey to wage-slavery for the entirety of the working class.
* Statistics on various mid-19th century industries show an increased productive capacity and a decreased number of workers employed. The vast majority of factory workers are women and children.
* The number of workers employed can remain the same or increase despite increasing worker displacement by machinery. This is possible when the industry expands at such a rapid rate that though the balance of constant:variable capital swings towards the constant, the absolute quantity of variable capital (workers) increases as well.
* As machinery and large scale industry develop, higher quality commodities are produced more cheaply, and consumers foreign and domestic will buy these cheaper products instead of those produced by artisans and handicraftsmen. Thus machinery and large scale industry displaces skilled workers not only in its home country, but worldwide.
* Another effect is an economic motive for colonization by the industrialized country. A worldwide division of labor emerges with rich industrialized countries producing commodities in mechanized factories employing devalued unskilled labor, using raw materials produced in other countries that have been colonized for this purpose. It is in the capitalists' interest to keep these countries poor and undeveloped, so they can pay the lowest possible wage. Capital-friendly government (fascists) can be installed if necessary to keep the people in line.
* "The life of industry becomes a series of periods of moderate activity, prosperity, over-production, crisis, and stagnation." (p.580)
* Except in periods of prosperity, capitalists compete for market share by improving productivity, and by reducing wages (even further) below the value of labor-power.
* Thus the industrial cycle leads to a parallel cycle in labor, with the worker alternately exploited by low-wage menial factory work during periods of production, and unemployed during periods of crisis.
* Capitalists began to use (cheaper) inferior raw materials, and then docked workers' pay when, for example, the rate of breakage increased due to poor quality cotton.
* When the capitalists owned the workers' homes, they would pre-deduct rent from the already miserable wages.
* Capitalists would experiment with various methods to cheapen their product, passing on losses to the workers, and harming workers' health as many of the methods exposed them to hazardous materials or conditions.

#### 8. The Revolutionary Impact of Large-Scale Industry on Manufacture, Handicrafts, and Domestic Industry
##### (a) Overthrow of Cooperation Based on Handicrafts and Domestic Industry
* Machinery replaces cooperation based on handicrafts, i.e. the reaping machine which replaces cooperation between reapers.
* Machinery also replaces manufacture based on the handicraft division of labor, i.e. the needle-making machine. Ten men could manufacture 48,000 sewing needles per day, compared to 145,000 needles per day produced by one needle-making machine. One woman or girl could superintend four of these machines, making her daily output of needles close to 600,000, compared to 4,800 of a single manufacturing man.
* A single machine could be the basis of an industry of handicraft character, i.e. the "cottage factories" of the Coventry ribbon industry where a centrally located machine provided power to looms located in surrounding cottages. This sort of arrangement is a temporary step on the way to the factory system; after 12 years the Coventry cottages could no longer compete with factories and were replaced.

##### (b) The Impact of the Factory System on Manufacture and Domestic Industries
* The factory system both expanded the system of manufacture and fundamentally altered its character.
* Machine production took the concept of division of labor from manufacture and automated each step, eliminating the need for skilled human labor and any hierarchy of skills and wages that accompanied it.
* Thus the new system prioritizes "cheap labor": women, children, and unskilled workers.
* Exploitation in manufacture is worse than in factories. The same "cheap" laborers in manufacture must do the work by hand, and are exposed to poisonous substances in the process.
* Domestic industry may be the most shamelessly exploitative of all, because the physical isolation of the workers prevents their organizing, middlemen take cuts of their wages, and they are in competition with manufacture, factories, and one another for dwindling employment.

##### (c) Modern Manufacture
* Conditions of manufacture in Marx's time: women and children were employed in a range of unhealthy jobs, such as London printers that earned the name "slaughter-houses".
* Rag sorters (also preferentially women and children) are carriers for smallpox and are themselves its first victims.
* The average day for brickmakers lasts from 5am–8pm, sometimes longer, employing children as young as four.
* Children in these conditions are exposed to "low language" and "filthy, indecent, and shameless habits" of the older workers, resulting in "great moral degradation" (p.593).
* After work, the laborers (including the children) indulge in "excessive drunkenness" to forget their torturous existence.

##### (d) Modern Domestic Industry
* In the lace industry, the Factory Act of 1861 drastically improved the spread of tuberculosis (consumption). This only applied to factory workers though, and the majority of lace workers worked in domestic industry, either in "mistresses' houses" or at their own homes.
* Mistresses' houses were packed tight with women and children sometimes younger than 5 years old, with poor air quality and ventilation. The average day was 12 hours but sometimes they worked 18 hours, and were beaten if they didn't work hard enough.
* Pillow lace-making was conducted in similar conditions, in the filthy and cramped cottages of poor women. Children as young as 2 years old were employed in such "lace schools".
* Another domestic industry, that of straw-plaiting, employed children as young as 3–4 years old, and offered even less space. Dr Ballard gave 300 cubic feet as the minimum space for each worker, yet "lace-schools" provided "12 2/3, 17, 18 1/2, and below 22 cubic feet for each person".
* Working class parents were desperately poor and were forced to subject their children to such a childhood of toil. Children growing up in these conditions are damaged emotionally, physically, and morally.
